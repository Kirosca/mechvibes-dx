//! `AttachConsole(ATTACH_PARENT_PROCESS)` borrows the parent's console when
//! there is one. It is deliberately *not* paired with `AllocConsole`: a
//! headless run started from Task Scheduler or a login item has no parent
//! console, and popping a new window there would defeat the point of the mode.
//! In that case output goes only to the in-memory log buffer, which every
//! logging macro already tees into.
