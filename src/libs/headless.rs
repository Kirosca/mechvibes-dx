//! Headless mode: the audio engine and the real input capture, with no
//! window, webview or tray.
//!
//! # Why it exists
//!
//! Two audiences. People who want the sounds without a GUI process (a login
//! item, a tiling-WM setup, a machine where the window is just overhead), and
//! people whose WebView2 / webkit2gtk install is broken - for them the window
//! cannot open at all, and this is the difference between a working app and no
//! app.
//!
//! # What it deliberately reuses
//!
//! The input capture is *the same* one the GUI wires, not a simpler
//! substitute. On Windows that means the Raw Input worker process
//! (`input_worker_host`), never the rdev fallback: rdev's `WH_KEYBOARD_LL`
//! hook eats dead keys and delays clicks (see the phase 06 findings), so
//! reaching for it here because it is fewer lines would ship a mode that is
//! quietly worse than the GUI. `bootstrap::start_input_capture` is shared with
//! `main()` for exactly that reason - there is one wiring, and both modes get
//! it.
//!
//! # Config is read, never written
//!
//! Volume, device selection and the enabled-device filter all come from
//! `config.json`, and nothing here writes back to it. That includes the mute
//! hotkey: the engine's own Ctrl+Alt+M handler persists `enable_sound`, so
//! this loop consumes the hotkey *before* the engine sees it and flips a
//! session-local flag instead. A headless run leaves the file byte-identical,
//! which is what makes `--soundpack` safe to use as a one-off without
//! disturbing the GUI's settings.
