//! The "Update now" button and its state machine.
//!
//! Downloading is a deliberate user action: a background check only ever
//! *notifies*, and nothing is transferred until this button is clicked. One
//! click then carries the update all the way through - download, verify,
//! launch the installer, close the app - with no second confirmation:
//!
//! ```text
//! Idle       "Update now"
//!   click -> Downloading  spinner + "Downloading new version..." (disabled)
//!         -> installs and exits automatically once verified
//!         -> Failed       reason + "Retry", until a newer version appears
//! ```
//!
//! An installer left staged by an interrupted session is picked up on the next
//! launch (`restore_staged_update`), so clicking again reuses it rather than
//! downloading a second time.
//!
//! `Failed` records the version it failed on. It persists as a "Retry" button
//! rather than clearing itself, so a failure is never silently forgotten, and
//! a release newer than that version resets it to "Update now" - retrying a
//! version that is no longer the latest would be the wrong offer. The browser
//! link that predates the staged-download flow sits on its own line below
//! `Retry`, because retrying cannot help a release with no installer asset.
